Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the sum of the populations of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Asia'.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SELECT SUM(a.pop)
FROM (SELECT c.COUNTRYCODE, c.POPULATION AS pop, ct.CONTINENT
FROM CITY AS c
JOIN COUNTRY AS ct
ON ct.CODE = c.COUNTRYCODE
WHERE ct.CONTINENT = 'Asia') AS a;
