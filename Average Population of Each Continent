Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city 
populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SELECT ct.continent, FLOOR(AVG(c.population))
FROM city as c
join country as ct
ON ct.code = c.countrycode
GROUP BY ct.continent;
