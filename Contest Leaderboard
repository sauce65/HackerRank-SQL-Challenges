You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, 
name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort 
the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.

SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, SUM(s.score) AS total_score FROM 
(SELECT hacker_id, challenge_id, MAX(score) AS score FROM Submissions GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id) AS s
JOIN Hackers AS h ON h.hacker_id = s.hacker_id
GROUP BY s.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING total_score > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, h.hacker_id ASC;
