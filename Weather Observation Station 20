A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(S.LAT_N,4) 
FROM STATION AS S 
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) 
       FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < S.LAT_N ) 
       = (SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) 
          FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > S.LAT_N);
          
# This one was interesting, first I was trying to divide a COUNT by 2 and use that in an index search.
# However, I found it was easier to say "find the lattitude where the number of rows below it is equal to the
# number of rows above it.
