Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 

Founder

Lead Manager

Senior Manager

Manager

Employee

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, 
total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then 
the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

SELECT Company.company_code, Company.founder, COUNT(DISTINCT Lead_Manager.lead_manager_code), COUNT(DISTINCT Senior_Manager.senior_manager_code), COUNT(DISTINCT Manager.manager_code), COUNT(DISTINCT Employee.employee_code)
FROM Company
JOIN Lead_Manager
ON Lead_Manager.company_code = Company.company_code
JOIN Senior_Manager
ON Senior_Manager.company_code = Lead_Manager.company_code
JOIN Manager
ON Manager.company_code = Lead_Manager.company_code
JOIN Employee
ON Employee.company_code = Manager.company_code
GROUP BY Company.company_code, Company.founder
ORDER BY Company.company_code ASC;
